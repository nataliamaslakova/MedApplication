# MedApp

Pharmacotherapy is still one of the most used medical interventions. Patients of all ages and conditions, however, encounter hurdles when it comes to incorporating medications into their daily routines, comprehending their benefits and side effects, and monitoring outcomes. How about an app that not only allows the users to add their medications, but also indicates the specific dosage only by scanning a prescription or medication? That's exactly what MedApp does.


MedApp is a user-friendly Android application that makes the adherence of medications as easy and accurate as possible.  The scanning option is what sets MedApp apart from the other apps. Therefore you can use the camera of your phone or an image from the gallery.
